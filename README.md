## Alumni_360: Project Description
*Alumni_360(A circle of our Alumni ): -  is a platform designed to connect current students with our placed alumni. The portal currently  features  50+  verified Alumni  profiles, with each profile personally authenticated to ensure credibility. Profiles include the alumni's name, profile image, company name, role, batch, and LinkedIn profile.

*Users can search for alumni based on their domain, such as Java Developer, Product Manager, AI/ML Specialist, or Software Engineer, allowing students to seek mentorship, referrals, and other forms of assistance. Due to the sensitive nature of the data, access is restricted to registered users with a valid ID and password.

*An admin panel allows administrators to manage all registered users, send notifications, and control profile access. Current students can register in this portal as domain student nd company college name, and once they secure a placement, they can update their profiles to join as alumni network. Administrators can then verify and add them to the list of placed alumni.

*Alumni_360 fosters a supportive network, ensuring continuous engagement and professional growth between our alumni and current students.
